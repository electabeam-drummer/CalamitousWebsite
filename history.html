        <h3 class="history"><b>Formation</b></h3>
        <p>Calamitous was formed in late 2023 by founding members Savva Belavsky-Levitan (Drums),
            Francis Healy (Guitar) and Tristan Bond (Vocals) in Boyne Community School when Savva met 
            Francis at a lunchtime concert gig with Tristan joining soon after. It wasn't long before
            they began to have their first rehearsals on the balcony of their own school to proffessional
            rehearsal studios nearby, <i><b>Silent Screams</b></i> was a song that was drafted at one of those rehearsals, 
            but the song would be complete only a year later. In the meantime the band spent their time playing
            covers and playing various gigs in school. 
        </p>

        <p>
            By the end of 2024 <i><b>Silent Screams</b></i> was completed and all they needed was a full Band
            since at the time they survived as a trio for over a year. Over the next few months the band searched
            for a rhythm guitarist and a bassist to fill the band, by July the band have recruited 3 new members;
            Sean Farrell (Rhythm Guitar), Toby Jones/Tobias Maximus (Bass) and Maks Sadlon (Sound Engineer) and on August
            8th, <i><b>Silent Screams</b></i> was released to all streaming platforms which as of making this has emassed 
            over 5,000 streams with more coming each day.
