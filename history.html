        <h3 class="history"><b>Formation</b></h3>
        <p>Calamitous was formed in late 2023 by founding members Savva Belavsky-Levitan (Drums),
            Francis Healy (Guitar) and Tristan Bond (Vocals) in Boyne Community School when Savva met 
            Francis at a lunchtime concert gig with Tristan joining soon after. It wasn't long before
            they began to have their first rehearsals on the balcony of their own school to proffessional
            rehearsal studios nearby, <i><b>Silent Screams</b></i> was a song that was drafted at one of those rehearsals, 
            but the song would be complete only a year later. In the meantime the band spent their time playing
            covers and playing various gigs in school.
